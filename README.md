## **Abstract**
Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) is an inherited autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the APC gene. The goal of this study was to identify candidate genes as well as protein interactions causing the disease phenotype, investigate DNA polymorphisms associated with altered gene expression, and propose a hypothesis to identify the disease mechanism. Key findings include the creation of a PPI network centered around APC, polymorphisms that may disrupt gene expression, and hypotheses for non wild-type gene expression.
